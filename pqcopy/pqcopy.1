.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program copies data-products from product-queue \fIinPath\fP to
the existing product-queue \fIoutPath\fP.
By default,
.B pqcopy
starts at the front of the product queue (the oldest products) and iterates
through products in order until it reaches the end of the queue (the most
recently inserted products).  On reaching the end of the queue it exits.
.LP
.B pqcopy
is typically used when resizing the LDM product-queue.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.  A line is emitted for every product in the queue whose
feed type and identifier match the specified feedtype and pattern.  The
emitted line contains the UTC date and time, the program name, the product
ingest time, feedtype, sequence number, size in bytes, and the product
identifier.
.TP
.B -x
Debugging information is also emitted.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Copies from the input product queue only products that have a feedtype that is a
member of the \fIfeedtype\fP set.  The default is `ANY', specifying all
feed types.  See \fBpqact\fP(1) for a list of basic feed types
and the use of feedtype expressions to specify combinations of basic
feed types.
.TP
.BI \-p " pattern"
Reads from the input product queue only products whose identifier
matches the regular expression \fIpattern\fP.
The default is `\fB.*\fP', specifying all products.
.TP
.BI \-o " offset"
Offset time, in seconds.
Begin reading products inserted into the product queue \fIoffset\fP
seconds earlier than the current time.
The default is to read all products
in the queue.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination.
.TP
.BR SIGINT
Immediate termination.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Refresh logging (if configure(1) executed without the "--with-ulog" option) and
write status and product statistics to log output.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Cyclically increment the verbosity of the program. Assumming the program was
started without the \fB-v\fP or \fB-x\fP switches, the first \fBSIGUSR2\fP will
make it verbose and \fBLOG_INFO\fP priority messages will appear.
The second will turn on the \fBLOG_DEBUG\fP priority messages as well.
A third will take it back to the normal state.
