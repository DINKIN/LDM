.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program sends LDM data from a local product queue (see \fBpq(3)\fP)
to an LDM server, \fBldmd(1)\fP.
The server would be on another machine, or the queue
used by \fBpqsend\fP would not be the queue in use by the server.
.LP
This program "offers" data, and is an alternative to the "request" mechanism
used by server to ask for data. In most cases, the "request" method would
be preferred. This program would typically be used with \fBpqing(1)\fP to
distribute the ingesters to various machines in a tightly coupled local network.
.B pqsend
may also be used for one time synchronization product queues after outages
or reconfigurations.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-h " remote"
Attempts to send data to LDM server on \fIremote\fR.
This is a required argument.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose logging.  A line is emitted for every product in the queue that is
sent.  The emitted line contains the UTC date and time, the program name,
the product ingest time, feedtype, sequence number, size in bytes, and the
product identifier.
.TP
.B \-x
Debugging information is also emitted.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Offers only products that have a feedtype that is a
member of the \fIfeedtype\fP set.  The default is "ANY", specifying all
feed types.  See \fBpqact\fP(1) for a list of basic feed types
and the use of feedtype expressions to specify combinations of basic
feed types.
.TP
.BI \-p " pattern"
Offers only products whose product-identifier is matched by the extended
regular expression \fIpattern\fP.
The default is ".*", which matches all product-identifiers.
.TP
.BI \-q " queue"
The pathname of the data product queue.
The default is 
.nh
\fB$(regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH})\fP.
.hy
The configuration value can
be overridden by setting the environment variable \fBLDMPQFNAME\fP.
.TP
.BI \-i " interval"
Polling interval, in seconds.  When the end of the queue is reached, the
program sleeps and
checks for new products in the product queue every \fIinterval\fP seconds.
When
.B pqsend
is run in the same process group as the programs that insert products into
the product queue, a signal informs
.B pqsend
and all other interested processes in the process group
whenever a new product is available, so polling is not necessary in this
case.  The default
interval is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-d
Decouple the \fB-T\fP and \fB-o\fP options; otherwise, the
time-offset value can't be greater than the total time-out
value and the product-queue cursor will never be earlier
than the total time-out ago.
.TP
.BI \-T " TotalTimeo"
Total timeout, in seconds.  
Maximum time for the program to execute.
The default total timeout is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
.TP
.BI \-o " offset"
Offset time, in seconds.
Offer products created \fIoffset\fP
seconds earlier than the current time.
The default value is \fITotalTimeo\fP.
.TP
.BI \-t " timeout"
Remote procedure call (RPC) timeout, in seconds.
The default RPC timeout is 25 seconds.

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination.
.TP
.BR SIGINT
Immediate termination.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Refresh logging (if configure(1) executed without the "--with-ulog" option) and
write status and product statistics to log output.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Cyclically increment the verbosity of the program. Assumming the program was
started without the \fB-v\fP or \fB-x\fP switches, the first \fBSIGUSR2\fP will
make it verbose and \fBLOG_INFO\fP priority messages will appear.
The second will turn on the \fBLOG_DEBUG\fP priority messages as well.
A third will take it back to the normal state.
.TP
.B SIGCONT
Wake up if sleeping, because there is a new product in the queue.

.SH "ACCESS CONTROL"
An ACCEPT line in the ldmd.conf file used by the \fIremote\fR will
effect what data is actually sent. This program signs on with a HIYA remote
procedure call to determine this. The remote performs an intersection
of the command line feedtype specification and the data which the remote
is willing to accept, suppling its pattern specifications.  Any pattern
supplied on the command line by this program is not used.

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
The following invocation will offer IDS products from the product queue
/tmp/ldm.pq and send them to an LDM server running on host
ldmhost.dept.univ.edu
.RS +4
  pqsend -q /tmp/ldm.pq -f IDS -h ldmhost.dept.univ.edu
.RE
.LP
The following invocation will attempt to send the last hour's data of any type
from the default product queue to an LDM server running on host
ldmhost.dept.univ.edu
.RS +4
  pqsend -xvl - -o 3600 -T 3600 -h ldmhost.dept.univ.edu
.RE
Log messages will be written to the controlling terminal.
The program should be terminated manually when the "End of Queue" message
is displayed.
