# Performs an acceptance-test of a package on a Linux virtual-machine system.
#
# Preconditions:
#       The current working directory contains the following:
#           - The source-distribution tarball;
#           - The release-variables file "release-vars.sh"; and
#           - The Vagrant-file "Vagrantfile".

# Usage: $0 vmName
#
# where:
#       vmName          Name of the Vagrant virtual machine (e.g.,
#                       "centos64_64", "precise32")

set -e  # terminate on error

# Parse the command-line
#
vmName=${1:?Name of Vagrant virtual-machine not specified}

# Set the release-variables.
#
. ./release-vars.sh

# Start the virtual machine.
#
# Problems with concurrent Vagrant/VirtualBox VM-s exist with Vagrant 1.6 and
# 1.7.2, and regardless of whether the "vagrant up" command is made sequential
# by a one-line flock(1) command or by an flock(1) block. Consequently,
# the concurrent Vagrant/VirtualBox VM-s are serialized.
#

# Workaround for concurrent VMs
#
#vagrant ssh -c date $vmName || flock . vagrant reload --provision $vmName

# On the virtual machine:

    # directory because that's where the "configure" script is.
    #
